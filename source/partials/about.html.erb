          <p>A fullstack developer passionate about learning both front end and back end based in Tokyo🗼. I studied English and American Literature in college, and after graduation I did a 9-week web development course at IT Bootcamp, where I developed many apps. I am looking forward to seeing how my career will be affected by the completely different paths I took while in college and after graduation. </p>
